# crud-silvan.tech-projects

> NOTE: I will not be using this, there are a lot of issues with it, the major one being 
I can only use it every 5 minutes, otherwise It'll desync with GitHub because GitHub raw
caches for 5 minutes. 

### If this code is somehow useful to you, there are a few things to do in order to make it work for you:
- In ```update.py line 7``` replace ```'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/silvan12/silvan.tech/master/Projects/current_projects.json'``` with your own link.

- In ```crud_functions.py line 4``` replace ```'ENTER TOKEN HERE'``` with your own token.

## But again, please don't use this, this could screw over your work really badly!
